# Changelog

## Unreleased

* We no longer change tilde characters (`~`) in URLs to their percentage-encoding *(`%7E`) as part of the downcasing process. Thanks {Yegorov}[https://github.com/Yegorov]!

* Added Rails 8.0 support (no changes).

## 2.0.0

* [BREAKING] We now rely only on rack-spec-compliant values to investigate the URLs. This should improve compatibility with different application servers. In particular, this means we now ignore the `REQUEST_URI` value and rely solely on `PATH_INFO`. If your application relies on `REQUEST_URI` being downcased, this could be a breaking change.

* Added support for URLs with non-ASCII characters in them. In other words, your application shouldn't get stuck in a an infinite redirect loop when a request contains non-ASCII characters that can be downcased.

* Added Ruby 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 to the test matrix.

* Added Rails 6.1.x, 7.0.x, 7.1.x to the build matrix.

* Dropped support for Rails 4. Going forward we're targetting Rails 5.x (and 6.x). Rails 5 deprecates a few configuration options that we need access to. If you still need support for Rails 4.x, version 1.2.2 of route_downcaser should work just fine.

* Dropped support for Rails versions older than 5.2 (ie 5.0.x, 5.1.x). They are outside Rails official maintenance policy.

* Dropped support for Ruby versions older than 2.7 (ie 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6). They are EOL and should not be used in production. We are keeping support for 2.7 around a bit yet, as to have support for at least one 2.x version.

## 1.2.3

* Sinatra users no longer need to `require "active_support"` manually to prevent `NoMethodError`s. Thanks, {Blake}[https://github.com/blakebuthod].

## 1.2.2

* Fixed bug where redirecting multibyte URLs would result in a `Rack::Lint::LintError` (Issue #29).

* Don't lose parts of the querystring when it contains multiple questionmarks. Thanks, {rmeritz}[https://github.com/rmeritz].

## 1.2.1

Support for Rails 5.1, we now support most recently released versions of Rails 4.2, 5.0, and 5.1. Thanks to {pepawel}[https://github.com/pepawel].

No more deprecation warnings about passing strings or symbols to the middleware builder. Thanks, {flou}[https://github.com/flou]!

## 1.2.0

Support for multibyte characters - dependency on ActiveSupport version 3.2 or later

## 1.1.5

Configuration now namespaced to avoid name clashing with other modules. Thanks goes to {tgk}[https://github.com/tgk] for this

## 1.1.4

Better solution to the incompatibility issue with Warden. Thank you to {l3akage}[https://github.com/l3akage]

## 1.1.3

Fixes issue #14. If Devise/Warden is used in the Rails app, RouteDowncaser::DowncaseRouteMiddleware needs to be inserted before Warden::Manager in the middleware list.

## 1.1.2

POST requests must never result in a redirect, even if the config.redirect is true

More robust test-cases have been added

## 1.1.1

Fixed {issue #17}[https://github.com/carstengehling/route_downcaser/issues/17]. Thanks go to {TkiTDO}[https://github.com/TikiTDO]

Refactored main code and tests for much better structure

## 1.0.1

Refactored parts of the code to work with Rails 4.2.0

Redirection is now possible as a configurable option. Thanks goes to {Mike Ackerman}[https://github.com/mackermedia]

## 0.2.1

The gem has now been tested to work with Rails 4.0 (it mostly involved changes in the test dummy-app because of deprecations between Rails 3.2 and 4.0)

## 0.2.0

Asset urls are now ignored - important since filesystems may be case sensitive. Thanks goes to {Casey Pugh}[https://github.com/caseypugh]

## 0.1.2

Removed silly dependencies (sqlite3, etc.)
